/// system now hands this page a back item and the gesture with it. What is left that is still ours
/// is the simultaneous recognition below, which lets the edge drag run without having to win a
/// fight with the page's own scrolling.
///
/// ⚠️ THE DELEGATE IS BORROWED AND PUT BACK. A `UINavigationController`'s pop recognizer is one
/// object shared by every page on the stack, so taking its delegate and walking away would hand our
/// answer to whatever screen came next. The old delegate is remembered on the way in and restored on
/// the way out, which is also why this is a controller rather than a `.onAppear`.
///
/// ⚠️ `viewControllers.count > 1` IS THE WHOLE POLICY. Swiping on the root of a stack with nothing
/// to pop is what freezes a navigation controller mid-transition, and the system's own delegate
/// exists to say no to exactly that.
