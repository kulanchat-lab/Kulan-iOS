// MARK: - The two hide lists, read and written the same way from both pages

// ⛔ THERE ARE TWO SEPARATE HIDE LISTS AND THEY ALWAYS WERE — this is what makes the owner's
// 2026-09-05 request ("let me hide someone from my chat, from my glow, or both, independently")
// buildable without touching the model at all:
//
//   • CHAT   — `StoryAudienceStore.hiddenFrom`, written with `setHidden`. `appliesGlobalHide` is
//              true for Everyone alone, and Everyone resolves to your accepted chats, so this is
//              exactly "hidden from my chat". It also revokes the stories already up.
//   • GLOW   — the Glowers audience's own `.except` members, written with `store.update`. Glowers
//              resolves to the glow relationship and never meets `hiddenFrom` at all.
//
// Nothing in either path is intersected with the other, so a person can be in one, the other, both
// or neither. That independence is the feature, and the two helpers below exist so the Everyone
// page and the Glowers page cannot drift into writing it two different ways.
//
// `fileprivate`, not an extension on the store: the store lives in another file that other work is
// touching, and a helper declared here cannot collide with one added there.

/// Is this person left out of the Glowers audience?

/// it: nobody excluded is `.all`, somebody excluded is `.except`. Written as a rule rather than
/// chosen, so the stored mode cannot disagree with the stored list.

/// ⚠️ THE UNION IS FOR THE LIST ONLY. It decides who gets a row on this page and nothing else; the

/// off every story that is already up (see its own note), so that switch is not only a rule for the
