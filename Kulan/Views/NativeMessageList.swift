// ============================================================================================
// TOP-DOWN, THE WAY THE REFERENCE APP'S LIST IS (2026-08-25, un-inverting the 2026-07-28 rewrite)
// ============================================================================================
// From 2026-07-28 to today this list was drawn UPSIDE DOWN: the collection view carried a scaleY(-1)
// transform, every cell carried the counter-flip, item 0 was the newest message at content y = 0, and
// paging history appended beyond the far edge so nothing the reader could see ever moved. That bought
// a real thing: "keep the reader still" became a property of the coordinate system instead of a
// calculation, and a family of scroll-jump bugs died with it. The record of those bugs, and of the
// four fixes that each found a real cause before the inversion, is in the git history of this file.
//
// IT IS TOP-DOWN AGAIN, AND THE REASON IS THE HEADER (owner, 2026-08-25: "where is the iOS 26 Liquid
// Glass blur in the top header? [The reference app] has it."). That blur is not a view anybody writes;
// it is the system's scroll edge effect, which iOS 26 draws under a navigation bar for any scroll view
// by default. Their list is a plain top-down collection view, so they get it free. Ours was inverted,
// and the system's effect cannot tell which edge is which on a mirrored scroll view: on device it
// washed the whole chat three separate ways in July, and five hand-made blur bands failed after that.
// The verdict written at the old setup site ended: "the honest answer is to stop imitating it and
// un-invert the list so Apple's own effect works." This is that.
//
// WHAT THE UN-INVERSION KEEPS, so the jump family does not simply come back:
//
//   * Heights are still measured up-front (UIHostingController.sizeThatFits at the real width, cached
//     by row id) and fed to a layout that stacks exact frames. Cells never self-size and the first
//     frame drawn is final. That was never the problem.
//   * The continuity mechanism is unchanged and it was always orientation-agnostic: the visible row
//     nearest the coordinate origin is the anchor, its frame is mapped before and after every change,
//     and the difference rides the layout's own `contentOffsetAdjustment` INSIDE the update
//     transaction, never a frame late. In the inverted list that delta was almost always zero. Here it
//     is non-zero for exactly the changes that happen ABOVE the reader: a page of history landing, a
//     row above them growing, a deletion above them. Same one formula, one net behind it.
//   * "At the newest message" is `contentOffset.y >= maxContentOffsetY - 5`, which depends on
//     contentSize. That is the dependency the inversion removed, and the reason it was removed is
//     written down: a keyboard fold could shrink the maximum under a reader in history and read as
//     "at the bottom". Every place that asks the question now asks it at rest, with the layout
//     settled, and the keyboard path asks it against the clearance it last established, i.e. BEFORE
//     geometry moves (see `updateInsets`).
//
// What can bite again, said plainly: a row the reader has never seen, sized wrong by the off-screen
// sizer (see `sizerRefused`), now sits ABOVE them after a page-in, and a wrong height there is a jump
// of that many points when the row finally renders and corrects. The reference app carries the same
// exposure with the same mitigation, measurement before layout, and lives with it.

    // WHAT WAS WRONG HERE, and why every earlier attempt split between his two phones: the keyboard
    // reached this list only through the safe area SwiftUI hands the hosted controller, and WHEN that
    // arrives relative to the keyboard's animation block is SwiftUI's business and differs by OS.
    // Each attempt added a clock, a latch or a settle to paper over that ordering. Theirs has no
    // ordering to get wrong: the guide is UIKit's, it changes inside the keyboard's own block, and the
    // one offset write there inherits the keys' real duration and curve. Every notification observer,
    // the captured clock, the willHide latch, the did-show/did-hide settles and the pending-settle
    // hand-off are gone with it.
    //
    // OURS, in their terms:
    //   bottom clearance    = keyboard band + composer bar + 12. The band is the guide's height: the
    //                         keyboard when it is up, the home-indicator strip when it is down.
    //   contentInset.bottom = bottom clearance − safeAreaInsets.bottom, so the ADJUSTED bottom is the
    //                         clearance whatever SwiftUI puts in the safe area and whenever it does.
    //   top clearance       = pinned bar + a short thread's shortfall; `.always` folds the nav bar.
    //
    // "WAS AT THE BOTTOM" IS ASKED AGAINST THE LIVE BOUND, as theirs is. It used to be asked against
    // a stored clearance because SwiftUI's safe area could move the live bound before the guide did;
    // the list ignores the keyboard safe area now, so only this method moves the bound.
    /// ⛔ WHERE THE KEYBOARD IS. This block used to say the controller keeps no keyboard state at
    /// all, because for one build it did: the composer pinned straight to `view.keyboardLayoutGuide`
    /// and every notification observer deleted, which is their iOS 16+ arrangement exactly.
    ///
    /// ⚠️ THAT HELD ON iOS 26 AND FAILED ON iOS 27 — owner, after build 705: "the bugs are iOS 27
    /// only; on iOS 26 everything works". The system guide tracks the keys inside this hosted
    /// controller on 26 and does not move on 27, so the bar was pinned to a guide parked at the
    /// home-indicator strip and sat at the bottom of the screen BEHIND the keyboard. The container
    /// height and the arrow's lift are both derived from where the bar is, so the list stopped
    /// reserving the composer's space and the arrow landed on the pill — three symptoms, one fact.
