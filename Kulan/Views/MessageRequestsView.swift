/// MESSAGE REQUESTS, AS A PAGE — owner, 2026-09-09: "Message Requests put when users click ... Chats
/// Open comtext menu inside chats and Message Requests when users click ... change page to make
/// requests message page". So: an entry in the chat list's own menu, and a page behind it.
///
/// ⚠️ THIS INVENTS NOTHING. A message request already exists and has since the feature was built —
/// see [MessageRequests], which owns the whole concept in two fields on the conversation
/// (`startedBy` and `accepted`) and answers "what is this chat" with one value. A conversation whose
/// stance is `.incoming` IS a message request, everywhere in the app, and that is the exact set this
/// page lists. There is no requests collection, no mirrored inbox and nothing new stored for this
/// screen, so the page cannot come to disagree with the thread, the chat list or the rules.
///
/// ⛔ IT DOES NOT REPLACE THE BAR INSIDE THE CONVERSATION. His original spec put Accept and Delete
/// "inside the conversation" rather than in a separate inbox, and ThreadView's `requestBar` still
/// does that. This page is a way to FIND them, not a second place to answer them: tapping a row
/// opens the chat, where the bar already is. Accept and Delete are also on the swipe and the long
/// press here, because a list you open in order to clear it should let you clear it — both call the
/// same two functions the bar calls, so there is one implementation of each answer.
///
/// ⚠️ AN ARCHIVED REQUEST IS STILL A REQUEST, AND THAT IS THE REASON THIS PAGE EARNS ITS KEEP.
/// Settings > Chats > "Automatically Archive New Chats From Unknown Users" moves a request into the
/// archive and mutes it (`UnknownChatArchiver`). Filtering on `isArchived` the way the chat list does
/// would hand an empty page to the one person most likely to come looking for this — the person who
/// turned that setting on. So the archive is deliberately NOT filtered out here.

    /// with the thread. Two filters are ours:
    ///
    ///   • BLOCKED IS OUT. Blocking is a separate action from declining, on purpose, but a person I
    ///     have blocked is not waiting on an answer from me and their name does not belong on a page
    ///     whose whole job is "who is waiting". The chat list and the tab badge exclude them too.
    ///   • CLEARED IS OUT, matching the chat list. `isCleared` is a timestamp comparison, so a new

    ///     is wanted, rather than a deletion that hides someone permanently.
