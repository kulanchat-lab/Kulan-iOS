// ⛔ THE CHAT LIST'S SEARCH IS ITS OWN PAGE NOW — owner, 2026-09-09, with a screenshot of ours:
// "When I click search button, Chatlist page and search page they are different, because search page
// has Recent … plz search Username and group … also search page make it uikit".
//
// What he photographed: tapping the search field left the chat list exactly where it was — Pinned
// and Chats headings, every row — with a keyboard drawn over the bottom half of it. The reference
// app never does that. Its search field belongs to a `UISearchController` whose
// `searchResultsController` is a SEPARATE view controller with its OWN table, and activating the
// field puts that controller over the inbox. Focus is the boundary between two pages, not a filter
// applied to one.
//
// This file is that second page. `ChatSearchPage` is shown by the chat list as an overlay for
// exactly as long as `\.isSearching` is true (see `chatSearchOverlay` in MainShell), which is the
// SwiftUI spelling of the same arrangement.
//
// ⚠️ TWO REFERENCES ARE MIXED HERE ON PURPOSE, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM COULD BE READ FROM SOURCE.
// The section list, their order and the empty-query behaviour below come from the reference app's
// own `ConversationSearchViewController`, read on 2026-09-09. **Recent does not exist in it at
// all** — its search page is blank until you type. Recent is from the other mainstream messenger he
// named, whose source we cannot read, so what is built here is HIS description of it and nothing
// more: the people and chats he has opened from search before, newest first, capped, clearable.
// Nothing about it is claimed to be a port.

/// ⚠️ A VIEW OF ITS OWN RATHER THAN A BRANCH IN THE CHAT LIST'S BODY, for two reasons.
/// `\.isSearching` is only readable from INSIDE the `.searchable` scope, so it has to be a view
/// placed there. And the chat list's body is one of the two in this app the type-checker has given
/// up on before ("unable to type-check this expression in reasonable time") — one initialiser at the
