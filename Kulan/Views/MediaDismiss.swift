import SwiftUI
import UIKit

// Interactive media dismiss — an interactive-dismiss + dismiss-animation controller pair:
//   • ONE vertical DirectionalPanGestureRecognizer on the presented viewer's root view.
//   • On begin, the live SwiftUI content is hidden ONCE and a LIGHTWEIGHT COPY of the media moves —
//     an image copy when available (a media transition image view), else a live snapshot of the
//     media's screen region. The copy sits in a shadow container (black 20%, offset (0,32), radius 48).
//   • Finger lock: copy.center = fromFrame.center + RAW translation, 1:1 both axes. The 0.8 scale and
//     shadow are a 0.2s "cock" scrubbed inside the 0.25s interactive timeline → they complete at
//     progress 0.8 and are NOT recomputed as functions of position.
//   • progress = clamp01(hypot(dx, dy) / 88)  (distanceToCompletion = 88pt).
//   • The presented root's alpha (black bg + chrome, media hidden) driven DIRECTLY from progress —
//     the reference app's fromView.alpha scrub. Zero per-frame SwiftUI work.
//   • Release: FINISH on any progress (percentComplete > 0 — no velocity gate) with the 0.25s
//     critically-damped spring toward a no-destination fallback frame (fromFrame shifted
//     down by its height); gesture-cancel springs everything back.
// Shared by the image viewer AND the video player — one code path.
