//
// THE STORIES ROW, IN UIKIT. (owner 2026-08-08: "completely change Stories row to UIKit ... do not
// change the design, appearance, layout, or behavior in any way".)
//
// This file replaces the SwiftUI `StoriesRow` that used to live in StoriesViews.swift — the
// horizontal scroller, my own card, the friend cards, the dip, the rings, the covers, the labels,
// the uploading placeholder and the two alerts. Nothing about it is meant to look or behave
// differently. Every number below was copied out of the SwiftUI version rather than re-chosen, and
// the notes that explained WHY a number is what it is have been carried across with it, because a
// number with no reason attached is the first thing a future edit gets wrong.
//
// WHAT STAYED SwiftUI ON PURPOSE, AND WHY IT IS NOT A GAP:
//  • `StoriesRow` is still the name MainShell constructs, with the same arguments in the same order.
//    It is a `UIViewRepresentable` now. MainShell was not touched — its `body` is already one very
//    large expression sitting on the type-checker's budget (see the ⚠️ note at its call site), and
//    the cheapest change to that file is no change at all.
//  • `StoryRingView`, `StoryImage`, `AvatarView`, `SkeletonFill` and `UploadingAvatarRing` are still
//    SwiftUI and are still used by other screens (the chat-list avatars, the viewer, the carousel).
//    They are NOT used here any more: this file draws its own, in UIKit, from the same measurements.
//    Two drawings of one thing is a maintenance trap, so each UIKit one below points at the SwiftUI
//    original it must stay equal to.
//
// THE FOUR CONTRACTS THIS ROW OWES THE REST OF THE APP, all of them unchanged:
//  1. `MediaOpenRects` — every card registers its own live UIView and window rect under
//     `key(.storyRow, <group id>)` at radius 24. The story flight flies to and from those, and
//     `menuTarget(at:)` hit-tests them. This got SIMPLER in UIKit: the registered view is now the
//     card itself rather than a transparent SwiftUI `.background` anchor. See `heroBox`.
//  2. `MediaSourceVisibility` — a card whose key is hidden draws at alpha 0, so the same picture is
//     never on screen twice while the flight or the lifted menu preview holds it.
//  3. `StoryRowLongPress.Coordinator` — the row's one press recogniser, unchanged, installed on this
//     scroll view directly instead of being found by walking up from a SwiftUI representable.
//  4. The row's HEIGHT, which MainShell reads to set the chat list's top margin. See `StoryRowMetrics`.
//
