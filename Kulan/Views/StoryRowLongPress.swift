//
// THE STORIES ROW'S LONG PRESS, ON THE APP'S OWN MENU.
//
// He asked for this and it was never started (build-state, "OPEN, HIS CALL (b)"): the row's long
// press in UIKit, with a real lifted preview per card instead of SwiftUI's `.contextMenu`.
//
// WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE SwiftUI ONE. `.contextMenu(menuItems:preview:)` does not lift the card —
// it BUILDS A SECOND ONE from the `preview:` closure. So the thing that rose off the row was a
// freshly constructed copy: its `StoryImage` started loading again (a beat of empty card on a cold
// cache), its avatar sat in a different place than the real card's, and it wore a caption the card
// itself does not have. Two views that have to look identical, maintained by hand, which is the
// mistake this codebase keeps writing down.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD. One `UILongPressGestureRecognizer` on the row's own scroll view, and the
// lift is a photograph of the card that is actually on screen — the same window-crop the story
// flight wears (`StoryCardShot`), at the card's own 24pt continuous radius. The menu is `CMOverlay`,
// the app's own long-press menu, so the row and the conversation now press the same way: one
// system, one set of numbers, one place to fix anything either of them gets wrong.
//
// ONE RECOGNISER, ON AN ANCESTOR, and both halves of that matter. A recogniser attached to a view
// laid OVER the card would have to be hit-testable, and then the card's own Button would never see
// a plain tap. On the scroll view it sees every press in the row without taking anything away: a
// tap never reaches the 0.2s threshold, so `cancelsTouchesInView` never fires and the tap opens the
// story as before; a real press recognises, UIKit cancels the touch the Button was tracking, and
// the story does NOT open behind the menu when the finger lifts.
//
// See [[kulan-story-row-isolation-rule]]: this area ships alone.
//

/// THE BELT FOR THE SAME BUG, because the gesture rule above depends on SwiftUI's Button being a
/// UIGestureRecognizer we can out-rank, and that is an implementation detail of a framework rather
/// than a promise. If a future SwiftUI drives its taps some other way, refusing simultaneity stops
/// meaning anything and the story opens on release again.
///
/// So the row's own open ALSO declines while a press owns the finger. The window extends past the
/// lift because a Button's action fires on touch-up, which is the same instant the recogniser ends,
/// and nothing orders those two.

// ⚠️ THIS WHOLE SECTION COMES OUT BEFORE ANYTHING SHIPS. `StoryPressDebug.on` goes back to false and

//
// The archive row's long press is on its FOURTH report. `f776c5f2` gave the climb a retry,
// `c44cbb6a` gave it the gated window fallback, `71a4bc7a` stopped an embalmed press from claiming
// to be installed — every one of them reasoned from this file, every one of them shipped, and he
// has reported it dead after each. Three rounds of reading concluded "this code is already
// correct", which is the same shape as the story-slot bug on 2026-08-10: when the arithmetic keeps
// saying it works and the screen keeps saying it does not, the MODEL is wrong, not the arithmetic.
// There is no Mac here to observe the real thing with, so the app answers instead.
//
// Three questions, in the order they can fail:
//   1. Did a recogniser get installed at all, and on WHAT — the row's scroll view, or the window?
//   2. Was it offered the press, and did the gate let it begin, or refuse it and why?
//   3. Did the handler run, and which of its guards turned it back?
//
// Whichever line is still a dash is the one that never happened, and that is the answer.
