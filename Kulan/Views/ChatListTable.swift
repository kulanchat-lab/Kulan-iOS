/// THE CHAT LIST AS A `UITableView`, because a row has to physically travel between sections.
///
/// ⛔ HIS INSTRUCTION, 2026-09-02, after three reports on the pin animation: "go start now, chat
/// list → UITableView". The last of those reports is what makes it necessary rather than tidy.
///
/// ⚠️ WHY SwiftUI COULD NOT FINISH THE JOB, stated once so nobody reverses this later. A row leaving
/// one `ForEach` for another is a DELETE and an INSERT to SwiftUI's diff — there is no spelling of
/// "this row moved to that section". So pinning crossfaded a row out of Chats and into Pinned, where
/// the reference app calls `moveRow(at:to:)` and the row flies. Everything else about their chat
/// list we matched in SwiftUI; this one thing has no SwiftUI equivalent at all.
///
/// ⚠️ THEIR STRUCTURE, READ FROM SOURCE (`CLVTableDataSource`, `ChatListViewController+Loading`) and
/// not from memory, which is what he asked for:
///   • `UITableView(frame: .zero, style: .grouped)` — grouped so headers scroll instead of floating.
///   • `separatorStyle = .none`.
///   • A header is a plain `UIView` with layout margins 14/16/8/16 and a `dynamicTypeHeadline`
///     label in `.label`; a titleless section returns `.leastNormalMagnitude`, and so does every
///     footer, "because we do not want that spacing".
///   • Changes are applied inside `beginUpdates()` / `endUpdates()`; sections are inserted and
///     deleted as sections, and a row that changes section is a `moveRow`, explicitly NOT a
///     delete-plus-insert, because that "results in a weird animation".
///   • `rowHeight = .automaticDimension`, `estimatedRowHeight = 60` (ours is 80 — our row is taller).
///   • They set no `estimatedSectionHeaderHeight` and no `sectionHeaderTopPadding`. Do not add
///     either "to make the header size properly"; a grouped table self-sizes a header from its own
///     constraints, and an estimate here changes the spacing they do not have.
///
/// ⛔ THE PIN ANIMATION IS NOT AN ANIMATION ANYBODY WROTE — owner's question, 2026-09-05, asking for
/// their pin/unpin movement to the frame. Read out of `applyRowChanges`: there is no spring, no
/// duration, no curve, no `UIView.animate`, no `CATransaction`. They pass
/// `UITableView.RowAnimation.automatic` and let UIKit run its stock row animation. What makes it
/// feel like theirs is three decisions, all of them in `apply(state:animated:)` and
/// `ChatListRowChanges.between`, and all three were wrong here before that date:
///   1. cross-section move = `moveRow`; same-section move = delete + insert.
///   2. the transaction is opened only when something needs it.
///   3. nothing runs after the transaction. The `reloadSections` that used to follow it fired on
///      every pin and cut the flight in half.
/// Do not "improve" this with a custom animator. The reference's answer is that there isn't one.
///
/// ⚠️ BUILT BESIDE THE SwiftUI LIST, NOT IN PLACE OF IT YET. This file is the table, its data
/// source, the swipe set, the context menu and the headings; multi-select, the search section, the
/// empty and skeleton states and the story-ring tap still live on the SwiftUI screen and have to be
/// carried over one at a time, each verified on his phone. Swapping the whole screen in one commit
/// is how this file's own history says the chat list gets broken.

        // message it would be most of the list every time.
        //
        // ⛔ AND THEN THE SPLIT THIS FILE GOT WRONG. Their own words, from `applyRowChanges`:
        //
        //     if we're moving within the same section, we perform moves using a "delete" and
        //     "insert" rather than a "move". This ensures that moved items are also reloaded. This
        //     is how UICollectionView performs reloads internally. We can't do this when changing
        //     sections, because it results in a weird animation. This should generally be safe,
        //     because you'll only move between sections when pinning / unpinning which doesn't
        //     require the moved item to be reloaded.
        //
        // So the two kinds of movement this list produces are not one operation:
        //
        //   • ACROSS sections — pin and unpin, and nothing else. `moveRow`, because a delete plus an
        //     insert across a section boundary is the "weird animation" their comment names, and
        //     the flight between the two lists is the whole reason this file exists.
        //   • WITHIN a section — a new message re-sorting the inbox. Delete plus insert, because
        //     that REDRAWS the row as it travels. A `moveRow` carries the cell it already has, so
        //     the row that just moved to the top because of a new message would arrive still
        //     showing the old preview, the old timestamp and the old unread count, and would only
        //     correct itself on the next unrelated reload.
        //
        // Ours emitted `moveRow` for both, which is why the pin flight was right and every ordinary
        // re-sort landed stale.
        // ⛔ A ROW THAT ONLY SHIFTED INDEX IS NOT A CHANGE, AND THIS IS THE PIN BUG — his fifth
        // report, 2026-09-09, and the first one diagnosed by reading their diff rather than their
        // table calls.
        //
        // ⚠️ WHAT THIS USED TO DO. Every surviving id whose index path was not identical became an
        // operation. Pin the third of eight chats and the five rows BELOW it each shift up one, so
        // each one was deleted and re-inserted — five fades out and five fades back in, playing
        // over the top of the one row that is actually flying. Pin something near the bottom of a
        // long list and nearly everything on screen flickers. That is "several bugs, especially the
        // animation and transition"; it is not a timing problem and no animation constant would
        // have touched it.
        //
        // ⛔ THEIRS EMITS NOTHING FOR THOSE ROWS. Their diff computes the MINIMAL set of moves over
        // the ids present in both lists: it filters both sides down to the survivors and then only
        // names a row that genuinely changed its ORDER relative to the others. On a pin the
        // unpinned survivors are already in the same relative order, so their whole transaction is
        // one delete and one insert, which their pin special case then collapses into a single
        // cross-section `moveRow`. One operation, not eleven.
        //
        // The minimal set is the complement of the longest run of survivors that is already in the
        // right order. Walk the new order, look each id up in the old order, and take the longest

    /// `automaticDimension` for their non-conversation rows only, and `measureConversationCell` for
    /// the pinned and unpinned sections. That measures ONE cell and stores the answer in a single
