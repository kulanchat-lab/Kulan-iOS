        // takes the touch, so the cell never learns a press happened. That was called a bug on

        // that is the one moment the list is on screen with a chat still on the stack — and it was
        // being cleared by `path.count` reaching zero, which happens when the pop FINISHES. So the

                        // The section gap went the same way: it was zeroed here because a `List`

                        // push - it ALSO sets the List's selection - and SwiftUI does not clear that on the
                        // way back, so the row stays SELECTED, and selected renders as a permanent grey fill.
                        // It is not a press highlight at all, which is why removing the custom press style
                        // did not fix it: the highlight was correct, the selection underneath it was not.
