//
// ONE DOOR FOR EVERY STORY.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The viewer used to be opened five different ways from five different files,
// and each of them had written its own close: `fullScreenCover` + Apple's `.zoom` in MainShell, the
// same again with a different spring in ArchivedChatsView, `ownSwipeDismiss: true` in MyProfileView,
// `ownSwipeDismiss: false` + a zoom in ContactInfoView, a fourth arrangement in ThreadView. Five
// copies of one interaction is why a fix to the story open never reached the profile, and why the
// scroll-down felt like a different gesture depending on which circle you had tapped — the owner's
// 2026-08-07 report in as many words.
//
// The presentation itself lives in `StoryZoomPresenter` (our screen, our gesture, our animation) and
// the flight lives in `StoryCardMorph`. This is the layer between them and the app: it knows how to
// build a viewer, what a close has to put back, and nothing else. Every screen that can show a story
// calls `StoryDoor.open` and passes the key of the thing that was tapped.
//
// WHAT A CALLER OWES IT. One `MediaRectReporter(id:scope:.storyRow, cornerRadius:)` on the view that
// was tapped, reporting its REAL corner radius. That radius is the whole shape system: a card reports
// 24 and the story lands as a card; an avatar reports half its width and the story lands as a circle,
// the reference app's way, with no branch here or in the morph. See `StoryCardMorph.applyCore`.

    // The viewer pages person to person, and for a long time nothing outside it knew that. The row
    // kept the position it had at the open, and the close asked "is the person he is on visible?" —
    // if the answer was no, because their card was off to the right of a row that had never
    // scrolled, it fell back to THE PERSON THE VIEWER WAS OPENED FROM. So Abdi → Ali → Salmo → Saki,
    // pull down, and the story flew home to Abdi. That fallback is his report exactly, and he named
    // the shape of the fix: do not special-case the opener, keep one live answer instead.
    //

    // a swipe forward, a swipe back, a carousel jump — and everything else reads it: the row scrolls
    // to it, the flight lands on it, the cover decides against it. One value, so the row, the
