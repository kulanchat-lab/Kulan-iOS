// ⛔ WHERE EACH CHAT WAS LAST BEING READ — the reference app's `lastVisibleInteraction`, in our shape.
//
// Theirs keeps two things per conversation: the id of the last visible interaction, and how much of
// that row was on screen (`onScreenPercentage`). On open, their scroll priority is focus message →
// unread indicator → **last visible interaction, restored to the same on-screen position**. Ours had
// the first two and stopped, so every re-entry to a long chat lost your place.
//
// ⛔ IT LIVES FOR ONE APP RUN AND NO LONGER, AND THAT IS A DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE FROM THEIRS.
// The owner ruled it on 2026-09-05: scroll to the middle of a chat, leave, come back in the same app
// session and you must still be where you were — but once the app has been killed and relaunched,
// opening that chat must land on the NEWEST message.
//
// Theirs does the opposite, and it was read from their source rather than assumed.
// `LastVisibleInteractionStore` is described in their own words as "Tracks the last visible
// interaction per thread (the interaction we last scrolled to)", and it keeps that pair in a
// key-value collection inside their message database, encoded as JSON under the conversation's
// unique id. A database row survives the process, so their cold launch still puts the reader back in
// the middle of the conversation. We take their shape and their open priority and leave their
// lifetime behind, because the owner asked for the newest message after a relaunch and he is the one
// reading it.
//
// So the store is a dictionary and nothing else. It starts empty on launch because a new process
// gets a new dictionary — there is no flag to reset, no expiry to get right, and no file that could
// outlive the run it belongs to.
//
// Main-actor only (written from the list controller's settle points).
/// Not `Codable` any more: the conformance existed only to write this to disk, and there is no disk
/// in this story now.

// ⛔ HEIGHTS A ROW HAS ACTUALLY RENDERED AT, KEPT ACROSS LEAVING AND RE-ENTERING THE CHAT.
//
// THE BUG (owner, 2026-08-28): open a chat, scroll up through older messages, leave, come back, and
// the messages jitter. Every time. It never settles.
//
// WHY IT ONLY HAPPENS AFTER SCROLLING. A reading position is stored only for a reader who is NOT at
// the newest message, so a chat you left at the bottom reopens at the bottom — and at the bottom
// `adoptHeight` re-pins to the bound, which hides every late height correction. Reopen mid-history
// and the very same corrections preserve an anchor instead, so each one visibly moves the list.
//
// WHERE THE CORRECTIONS COME FROM. Rows still drawn by SwiftUI — photos, albums, voice, cards — are
// measured off-screen by a sizer, and when they render they can disagree. The list already handles
// that: `sizerRefused` and `renderedHeights` record which rows lied and what they really are, and
// `measure()` then returns the truth. But both of those live on the view controller, which dies with
// the screen. So every re-entry threw the answer away and re-learned it from scratch, the same way,
// with the same jump. THAT is why it repeats forever rather than settling after the first time.
//
// This is that answer, kept where the screen cannot take it with it. Theirs has no equivalent because
// it needs none: their cells are laid out from a measurement computed before the cell exists and
// cannot report a different height, so there is nothing to re-learn. Ours self-size, so the closest
// honest thing is to stop forgetting.
//
// Keyed by width as well as chat: a height is only true at the width it rendered at, which is the
// same rule `viewWillLayoutSubviews` already applies when it drops the caches on a rotation.
//
// In memory only, deliberately, and for its own reason rather than the reading position's: this is a
// cache of something re-derivable that is worth nothing once the process is gone, while that one is a
// place the owner chose to be forgotten at every launch.
//
// Main-actor only by convention, exactly as `ChatScrollStore` above is: it is written from the list
// controller's measure and settle points and read from its first land, all of which are main-thread.
